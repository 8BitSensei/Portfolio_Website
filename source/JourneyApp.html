As a part of a university project I developed an Android app which takes the users currentl location
and reccomends uder-sourced locations nearby. To get the users location I saved myself some time by using
this <a href="http://www.androidhive.info/2012/07/android-gps-location-manager-tutorial">GPS Tracker class</a> I found online. I have it updating the location everytime it detects a change but there appears to be some serious bugs with GPS locations so in a future version this will probably be re-written.</br>
</br>
The app displays in a list-view all the locations within a 5 mile radius, the user can then select this and be shown there real time distance from the location and a compass pointing in it's direction. I calculate it's distance in miles using <a href="http://www.geodatasource.com/developers/java">this code</a> I found.
</br> I work out the direction the arrow needs to be pointing and rotate it using two methods, rotateArrow() and normalizeDegree() in the LocationDetails class.

Feel free to download it, rip it apart and re-use it for your own purposes, though if you do any acknowledgement would be appreciated.
