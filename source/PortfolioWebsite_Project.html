I developed a portfolio/blog website (probably the one you're on now) to show case my web development ability and provide a singular source to access my publicised projects and blogs that is entirely under my control.</br> The majority of the project took me about a week in total (developing it on and off in my spare time) to construct and publish online, I decided not to use any kind of professional CMS system but rather to construct the whole system myself (I’ll probably work on my own CMS system in the future, I’ll update this page if that happens).

Feel free to download it, rip it apart and re-use it for your own purposes, though if you do any acknowledgement would be appreciated.
